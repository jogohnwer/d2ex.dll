1- right click on 'dbghelp.dll' then paste to your Diablo II directory.
2----your diablo game should be installed at C:\Program Files(x86)\DiabloII
3-----and if its not then click on your start button > search > Diablo II ***note that the II is two i capitalized**

4-when it finds the main game directory right click > "Diablo II" > copy > go to desktop > right click empty space in desktop > paste **backed up d2 just in case**

5-go back to file where this "read me" txt file is right click > 'dbghelp.dll' > copy > paste in original "Diablo II" file (C:\program files (x86)\diablo II) 
**note the only way that the d2 file would not be in the (x86) file is because your version of windows is 64 bit never the less with the search function youll find it**

6-once thats done look in "diablo II" for "Game.exe" > right click > send to desktop (create shortcut) > go to desktop > find "game.exe-shortcut" > right click > properties >
7--on top of properties theres 6 tabs. click > shortcut > Target will have "C:\program files (x86)\Diablo II\Game.exe" **note this might look different if u have 64 bit version, 
8---never-the-less AFTER "ect ect\Diablo II\Game.exe" press space bar one time then type -w then press spacebar one more time type -d2dv=(your original d2 cd key) 
9----without the ( ) press space bar one more time type -d2xp=(your expansion cd key) then on tabs on top of property window click > compatibility > then click box 
10-----"Run as administrator" click > "Apply" > go back to shortcut > your target line code should look something like this

"C:\games\Diablo II\Game.exe" -w -ns -skiptobnet -d2dv=M7FBVTMFCBRRCV8 -d2xp=42HD8PZGCKKCV9C
**NOTE i have -ns = load with no sound  and -skiptobnet = go straight to bnet login screen**
***SECOND NOTE if you know which cd key you used to install diablo 2 with use your second (extra\new) cd key in shortcut***
****THIRD NOTE rename your shortcut to something like "Game extra" then go back to diablo folder and (instructions to find again on 3) then make another shortcut
	of game.exe on desktop (instructions on 6) do the same to this shortcut as u did last one without the cdkey part so it should look simmilar to >
	
	"C:\games\Diablo II\Game.exe" -w -ns -skiptobnet   **NOTE if u want to use the -ns=no sound and the -skiptobnet=directly to login screen its up to you**

--now your done you can name your shortcut whatever you like theres no need to add cd key to this one because the game will use the one its installed with by default--
	
	heres a list of all the target line codes that work now with this "mod"
	
		-clip	Clips the mouse cusor within the game's window. >>>>>>**NOTE when it says it stays in window it means it to be able to click outside of screen hit windows key
		-d2dv=key	Specifies the Diablo II CD key to use.              to be able to minimise the game screen**
		-d2xp=key	Specifies the Diablo II: Lord of Destruction CD key to use.
		-title=name	Controls the title of the game's window.
		-nofixaspect	enables stretch windowed mode to fit the screen.
		
		my three shortcuts on desktop (for 3 games at same time) look like 
		
		"C:\games\Diablo II\Game.exe" -title=D2lod1 -w -ns -skiptobnet -d2dv=94HRJKHEDBE -d2xp=EVBRD798DJMRVB ---title of game named D2lod1/windowed mode/no sound/straightght2login
		"C:\games\Diablo II\Game.exe" -title=D2lod2 -w -ns -skiptobnet -d2dv=6RBDBFM7C9WM -d2xp=GPM2V7RYERG7C ---title of game named D2lod2/windowed mode/no sound/straightght2login
		"C:\games\Diablo II\Game.exe" -title=D2lod3 -w -ns -skiptobnet -d2dv=RYXTVEKJW6MC -d2xp=6W64ZG98B7HCV ---title of game named D2lod3/windowed mode/no sound/straightght2login

*+*+*FINAL NOTE if ANYTHING happens like your game wont work or anyhting like that after this just right click on your backed up diablo 2 file on desktop and paste it over the 
	  original one in the c drive after hitting paste it will say theres already a file named diablo 2 just click MERGE > COPY AND KEEP NEW FILE there will also be a check box
	  that will do the same for other files (so you dont have to sit there and click a 1000 times lol)*+*
